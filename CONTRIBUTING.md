# Contributing

## Issue Reporting

Issue report are more than welcome, but to be efficiently handle you should
include your ruby version and a stacktrace.

## Proposal of Features
If there is a feature you would like to be added, just suggest it.

If you want to implement it yourself, I stringly recommand you to talk
about it first, posting a issue describing the intentinded feature,
and the main ideas about how you would implement it.

## Development
1. Fork it ( https://github.com/[my-github-username]/VeLibe/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
